# Narrator Voice legacy-script reuse audit — 2026-09-02

**Status:** Recorded input to ADR-0007 and the proposed Odia production design

**Question:** Which existing English/Hindi-era narration capabilities can safely help
the authorized SSGGSM/Odia/diary lane without importing the old voice policy?

## Decision rule

The repository contains useful production ideas, but most loose narration scripts are
research one-offs with hard-coded paths, models and policies. Reuse a demonstrated
technical capability only after extracting it behind the new lane-specific application
policy. Do not treat a script's existence, filename or former “live” status as release
authority.

## Reuse in the new workflow

| Existing capability | Evidence | Safe reuse |
|---|---|---|
| Native-language listening | `scripts/build_odia_check_site.py` asks an Odia listener to judge intelligibility and naturalness. | Make exact-text, pronunciation and naturalness review by a qualified Odia listener the release authority. Adapt the questions to generated narration. |
| Master-first and passage-level audition | `scripts/build_narration_gallery.py` and `scripts/assemble_diary.py` present a whole track plus individual chunks/takes and notes. | Preserve this reviewer journey: listen to the master, inspect a passage, compare preserved alternatives, record a decision and comment. Build a new adapter rather than using their old state model. |
| Careful ordered joining | `scripts/hi/reconcat_diary.py` trims only boundary silence and inserts a fixed gap. | Extract separately tested trim/normalise/assemble operations. Order comes from the manifest, not timestamps or similarity scores. |
| Blind A/B mechanics | `scripts/build_odia_check_site.py` uses opaque randomized slots and retains an answer key. | Use only for deliberate comparisons of two takes/profiles. Durable take IDs and review evidence remain unblinded in the manifest. |
| Audio diagnostics | `scripts/voice_quality.py` calculates generic signal features and documents limitations. | Show advisory diagnostics if useful; never promote them to an automatic Odia release gate. |
| Review-page interaction | `scripts/hi/build_casting_site.py`, `scripts/build_qa_gallery.py` and `scripts/assemble_diary.py` contain player, keyboard, notes and export patterns. | Reimplement/refactor the interaction against the new review commands and durable manifest. Do not reuse their casting claims, metric defaults or browser-local state as domain truth. |

## Do not reuse as Odia production policy

| Legacy area | Why it must not cross into Lane B |
|---|---|
| `scripts/hi/voice_gate.py`, `scripts/hi/vd_analyze.py`, `docs/voice-dissimilarity-gate-2026-07-20.md` | They intentionally enforce the old opposite goal: output must be dissimilar from SSGGSM. That remains relevant to Lane A only. |
| `scripts/hi/build_casting_site.py`, `scripts/hi/build_casting_gallery.py` casting assertions | They state that the historical voice will not be used and candidates were screened for dissimilarity. UI ideas are reusable; those assertions and verdicts are not. |
| `scripts/gate_takes.py`, `scripts/assemble_diary.py` automatic identity/calmness selection | They let metrics reject or select speech. ADR-0006 makes qualified Odia listening authoritative for Lane B. |
| `scripts/hi/asr_check.py` | It runs Hindi Whisper/CER against Hindi passages and fixed paths. It is not an Odia correctness gate. |
| `scripts/hi/analyze_diary.py`, `scripts/hi/expressive_refs.py`, `scripts/hi/score_hi_clones.py` | Their baselines, reference selection and thresholds are Hindi/historical-speaker experiments, not the approved Cartesia workflow. |
| `scripts/prep_narration.py` | It contains English diary preparation and lossy IAST-to-ASCII transliteration for a VoxCPM chunk limit, not NFC Odia input. |
| `cloud/narrate.py`, `cloud/narrate_funnel.py`, `scripts/hi/clone_test.py` and related VoxCPM/LoRA scripts | They generate with a different model, reference-transfer design and historic policy. ADR-0006 expressly does not revive the shelved VoxCPM/LoRA pipeline. |
| `scripts/build_narration_site.py` publication text | Its historical “AI reconstruction” wording and release page do not supply the publication/disclosure authorization that ADR-0006 leaves undecided. |

## Required seam before reuse

The first Odia implementation should expose provider-neutral ports for synthesis,
artifact storage, media inspection/assembly and review presentation. Lane-specific
application policy supplies the authorization binding, speaker, language, permitted
text scope and release rules before any adapter is called.

This keeps the valuable old ideas—human listening, compare-and-comment review,
immutable alternatives and careful assembly—while preventing four kinds of leakage:

1. non-SSGGSM dissimilarity policy;
2. Hindi/English text and ASR assumptions;
3. VoxCPM/LoRA provider and reference-audio assumptions; and
4. metric-driven release decisions.

The audit does not authorize deletion or rewriting of historical code. The `scripts/`
entries remain evidence and runnable research history under ADR-0003. That ADR
explicitly excludes `cloud/`; the two audited `cloud/` narrators remain ungoverned
historical evidence and are not authorized for either new production lane.
